    Will create new teams associated with the referenced obj and set the
    resulting relation to the correct attribute.

    The naming convention for team foreign keys is pluralname_team (for
    example, instructors_team).

    This function will take the access dictionary and apply the specified
    access types as follows:

    access = {
        'trainees_team': ('open', 'add someone'),
    }

    Where the key name is the team name and the tuple contains the access
    types for member access and manager access respectively.

    If the foreign key already has a value associated with it, this function
    will NOT create a new team to replace it.
